## Project Overview
This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi, focusing on the specific environmental challenges faced by the city. The analysis addresses key pollutants, seasonal variations, and the impact of geographical factors on air quality. The goal is to gain insights into the dynamics of AQI in Delhi to inform targeted strategies for air quality improvement and public health initiatives.


## Research Questions
1. Key Pollutants: What are the primary pollutants contributing to poor air quality in Delhi?
2. Seasonal Variations: How does the AQI in Delhi vary across different seasons?
3. Geographical Factors: How do geographical factors affect air quality in various parts of Delhi?


Data: The data for this project is sourced from [(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HoA9NrgIdRnyX1f5j8uuFV-RR5jdJgBp/view?usp=sharing)]. The dataset includes daily AQI measurements along with concentrations of key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.

Installation:
To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
   1. pandas
   2. numpy
   3. matplotlib
   4. seaborn
 
 You can install these packages using pip:
           
           pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


### USAGE:
1. Clone the Repository
          
          git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delhi-aqi-analysis.git
          cd delhi-aqi-analysis

2. Prepare the Data

   Ensure the dataset (delhiaqi.csv) is placed in the project directory.


3. Run the Analysis

   Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis. For example, if using a Jupyter Notebook:

              jupyter notebook AQI_Analysis.ipynb

### Analysis
The analysis involves:

 * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand the distribution and trends of AQI and its components.
 * Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to identify significant patterns and correlations.
 * Seasonal Analysis: Comparing AQI across different seasons to observe any seasonal trends.
 * Geographical Analysis: Mapping AQI data to visualize the impact of geographical factors.

### Results
The results section will include:

 * Detailed visualizations of AQI trends and pollutant concentrations.
 * Insights into the primary pollutants and their sources.
 * Seasonal variations and potential causes.
 * Geographical distribution of air quality levels.

### Conclusion
The project concludes with recommendations for improving air quality in Delhi, based on the analysis. It also suggests areas for further research and potential public health initiatives.
